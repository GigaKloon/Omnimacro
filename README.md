# Omnimacro
I made my own, all purpose macro.
To use the macro, simply download the file "The OMNIMACRO.py" and move it to your documents tab (I'm trusting you know a little bit about file structure.) 
Download python 3 interpreter from the web
Going into the terminal, type
"pip3 install pynput"

This will make a GUI pop up. Navigate the buttons, and find a preset that you like. I trust that you build the farms like how the manual built them. If you have any concerns, visit the islands of the owners of the farm designs, then copy the designs.
Finally, after running the macro, if you are on MacOS, you will see accesibility options. Give the terminal access to your keyboard and mouse. Then, QUIT terminal. This is because the accesibility options will cause the macro to become desynchronized. Instead, re-run the macro. There will be a delay of 5 seconds. The delay is intentional, for you to be able to navigate to your Minecraft Window. It also requires you to set you spawn point on the garden at the beginning of your farm, because it types "/warp garden" at the end. This is still in Beta mode, which means some features are going to vreaj
